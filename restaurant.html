<p> My favorite restaurant is called MSN. It is a bright and fun place where they make the best cheese pizza in town. I love how it smells when I walk in! You can see them toss the dough in the air and add all the tasty toppings. They even let kids make their mini chicken items. The people who work there are always friendly and make you feel special. The best part is when the hot, chicken comes to the table. Every bite is full of cheesy goodness. Going to MSN always makes me happy.
